description: How Ephyra picks the local address on a home Wi-Fi and the remote address elsewhere, checks it is the same server, presents a client certificate for mutual TLS, keeps the token in the keyring, and which errors it shows.

The route, the client certificate handling, the connection form, the
keyring and the media proxy are phosh-toolkit's `phosh_toolkit` package,
shared with Nauta; their general behaviour is described in
[shared connection and playback](../../phosh-toolkit/docs/shared-connection.md).
This file keeps what is Ephyra's: the Jellyfin probe and sign-in, the
account file and the secrets' names.

# The owner's setup

One Jellyfin server, reachable

- **at home** directly on the LAN, e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:8096`;
- **elsewhere** through a public URL behind a reverse proxy that
  requires a **client certificate** (mutual TLS).

# Route (`phosh_toolkit.route`, `phosh_toolkit.router`, `connection.py`)

The account stores a remote address, an optional local address and a
list of home Wi-Fi names (SSIDs). `route.candidates()` orders them:

| Situation | Tried in order |
|---|---|
| Connected to a listed home Wi-Fi | local, then remote |
| Other Wi-Fi or mobile data | remote only |
| No home list, or NetworkManager not reachable | local, then remote |
| Only one address set | that one |

Each candidate is asked for `/System/Info/Public` (no token
needed)[^jf-system]: 3 s timeout for the local address, 15 s for the
remote one. The first one that answers **with the server id stored at
sign-in** is used; another Jellyfin at the same LAN address never gets
the token. The window shows the result in the sidebar subtitle
("Home Media · Home network" / "Remote" / "Offline"), and an
`AdwBanner` with "Retry" when nothing answers.

The route is chosen again when `Gio.NetworkMonitor` reports a change
(debounced 1.5 s), and once after any request that fails with a
network error (`Connection.call` retries through the new route).

**SSID**: read from NetworkManager on the system bus
(`ActiveConnections` → `Type == 802-11-wireless` → `SpecificObject` →
`AccessPoint.Ssid`, falling back to the connection's `Id`)[^nm-dbus].
The Flatpak needs `--system-talk-name=org.freedesktop.NetworkManager`
for it. Without access (other distributions, desktop without NM) the
app tries the local address first everywhere, which the server id
check keeps safe.

Addresses are typed freely and normalized (`route.normalize`): without
a scheme they get `https://`, for the local address too (the owner's
rule, 2026-11-04); a typed `http://` or `https://` is kept, the trailing
slash goes. The field then shows the address as used. A local Jellyfin
on plain HTTP is entered as `http://192.168.1.10:8096`.

# Mutual TLS (`phosh_toolkit.tls`, `phosh_toolkit.http`, `phosh_toolkit.certificate`)

- The user picks a **PKCS #12** file (`.p12`/`.pfx`, with password) or a
  **PEM** file with certificate and unencrypted key. Ephyra keeps a
  private copy in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ephyra/client-certificate` (mode 600)
  and the PKCS #12 password in the keyring.
- Loaded with `Gio.TlsCertificate.new_from_pkcs12` / `new_from_pem`;
  a wrong password is `G_TLS_ERROR_BAD_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, shown on
  the password row.
- Every request sets it with `soup_message_set_tls_client_certificate`
  before sending[^soup-cert], so libsoup presents it when the server
  asks. It is also sent to the local address if that one asks.
- **Missing certificate**, recognised in three forms: GIO's
  `CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED`; with TLS 1.3 a received alert "Certificate is
  required" (the handshake completes before the server checks, verified
  with the tests' Python server); and nginx's HTTP 400 page "No required
  SSL certificate was sent". All become "The server asks for a client
  certificate" and mark the certificate row.
- The server certificate is checked against the system's CAs. Servers
  with a private CA are not supported yet (follow-up issue).

# Sign-in and secrets

`POST /Users/AuthenticateByName` with the `Authorization: MediaBrowser
Client="Ephyra", Device=…, DeviceId=…, Version=…` header[^jf-auth]; the
token comes back as `AccessToken` and is sent as `Token="…"` in the same
header from then on, never in URLs. Token and certificate password are
stored with libsecret (schema `de.nexumia.Ephyra`, attribute `kind`); in
the Flatpak libsecret uses the Secret portal. A `401` from the server
signs out and shows the setup page.

The account file `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ephyra/account.json` (version 1)
holds addresses, home networks, server and user ids and names, the
device id and the quality settings. A broken file is kept as `.bad`.

# Security notes

- At home the local address is usually plain HTTP: the token and the
  password at sign-in cross the home Wi-Fi unencrypted. Use an `https`
  local address if that matters.
- A Wi-Fi with the same name elsewhere makes Ephyra try the local
  address there; a stranger's server at that address fails the server
  id check, but anyone who fakes the public server info (no token
  needed) could still receive the token. Prefer an `https` local
  address, or leave the home list empty to always use the remote URL.

# Verified (2026-11-03, cloud container, Ubuntu 24.04, libsoup 3.4.4, GLib 2.80)

- `tests/test_connection.py`: the client against `ephyra/demo.py` over
  real mutual TLS (CA, server and client certificates made with
  `openssl`): refused without the certificate (`certificate-required`),
  works with the PKCS #12 file; PEM and PKCS #12 loading, wrong password,
  missing key; the route on a home network, elsewhere, with the local
  server down, and with a different server at the local address.
- `tests/test_ui.py`: the setup page marks the certificate row without
  a certificate, then signs in with it.
- Not yet on the phone: NetworkManager access from the Flatpak and the
  owner's real reverse proxy (issue in milestone M1).
