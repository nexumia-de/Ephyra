# Why

The owner wants Ephyra to look like Jellyfin's own apps, so the library
feels familiar next to the web client and the TV apps. It still has to
be a good Phosh app: adaptive at 360×720, touch first, libadwaita
widgets. Decision and trade-offs: [Jellyfin look](decisions/jellyfin-style.md).

# Rules

1. **Dark first.** `AdwStyleManager` is set to `PREFER_DARK`: dark
   unless the system explicitly asks for light. Jellyfin's default theme
   is dark[^jf-palette]; a light system still gets a light app.
2. **Jellyfin's blue as the accent.** `--accent-bg-color: #00a4dc` and
   dark text on it (`--accent-fg-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 87%)`, Jellyfin's
   `primary-contrastText`)[^jf-palette]. libadwaita derives the accent
   text colour, so links, checks and focus rings follow. Set only in
   `ephyra/style.css`; for libadwaita 1.5 hosts the same values are
   given as `@define-color`. White on `#00a4dc` would have too little
   contrast, hence the dark text.
3. **Surfaces stay libadwaita's.** Jellyfin's near-black `#101010`
   background is not copied: libadwaita's dark greys keep header bars,
   lists and dialogs consistent with Phosh and other apps.
4. **Posters are the content.** Libraries and home sections are grids
   of cards: 2:3 posters (1:1 for albums, 16:9 for "Continue Watching"
   and "Next Up"), rounded (`.ephyra-poster`, 8 px), title in `heading`,
   year or `S1:E4 · Episode` in `caption` + `dimmed` below. Two columns
   at 360 px, more as the window grows. No horizontal carousels:
   Jellyfin's scrolling rows become wrapping grids, and sections with
   more items have "Show All".
5. **Indicators like Jellyfin's.** A played item gets a round accent
   badge with a check in the poster's top right corner; a series gets
   its unplayed episode count there; a started item shows its position
   as a bar along the poster's bottom edge[^jf-card].
6. **Detail pages.** Backdrop at the top (16:9, at most 360 px high),
   fading into the page (`.ephyra-backdrop-fade`), then the title in
   `title-1`, a facts line (`2021 · 1 h 52 min · 12 · ★ 7.1`), the
   `suggested-action` pill "Play" or "Resume 40:00", round buttons for
   play from start, played and favourite, "Ends at 22:14", overview,
   genres. Seasons, episodes and tracks are `boxed-list` rows with
   thumbnails.
7. **Player.** Black letterbox (`.ephyra-video`, content colour), `osd`
   header and controls that hide after 3 s while a video plays and come
   back on a tap; seek bar, back 10 s, play/pause, forward 30 s,
   fullscreen.
8. **Everything else from the toolkit**: style classes before CSS,
   colours only through variables (data colours excepted), symbolic
   icons with tooltips and accessible labels, `AdwStatusPage`,
   `AdwToast` and `AdwBanner` for states, header capitalisation for
   titles and buttons. See the toolkit's
   [visual design](../../phosh-toolkit/docs/design.md) and
   [adaptive UI](../../phosh-toolkit/docs/adaptive-libadwaita.md).
9. **Not Jellyfin's brand.** No Jellyfin logo, wordmark or icon
   anywhere; the app icon is Ephyra's own (an eight-armed young
   jellyfish). The About dialog and the metainfo say Ephyra is not
   affiliated with the Jellyfin project.

# Review checklist

- [ ] 360×720 and 1000×700 screenshots, dark and light.
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling; cards two per row at 360 px.
- [ ] Accent only through `var(--accent-…)` or the badge/progress
      classes; no new hex colours in UI chrome.
- [ ] Played badge, unplayed count and progress bar still visible on
      the changed cards.
- [ ] Icon-only buttons have tooltips and accessible labels.
